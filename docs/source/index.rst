Diffstar: Differentiable Star Formation Histories
=================================================
Diffstar is a python library written in 
`JAX <https://jax.readthedocs.io/>`__ implementing a parametric model of 
galaxy star formation history based on a physical connection between 
the galaxy and its dark matter halo.
You can find more information about Diffstar in 
`our paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04273/>`__.

Diffstar is open-source code that is publicly available on
`GitHub <https://github.com/ArgonneCPAC/diffstar/>`__. 
These docs show you how to predict SFHs for individual and populations of galaxies
based on the Diffstar model.
